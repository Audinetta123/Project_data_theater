This application is a search engine developped with PHP 5 &+ (in a POO manner) to look for contemporary shows/theatres in the area specified by the user (France only for the moment) and based on the following open source API: http://www.ressources-theatre.net/doc/api/

What to do to use it?

1 Get the database spectacles.sql into your database manager

2 Export the entire project to your server

3 Fill up file .init.php in the folder "include" with your database infos (Initialisation of the database with current shows will be done at first load of index.php file)

4 Input post-code in the input text field

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Still to be done (in case you want to help... :)):

1 Front-end
2 Pagination to be reviewed
3 Refactore code and implement more options such as geolocation
